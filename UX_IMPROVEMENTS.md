# EditorJS Image Tool UX Improvements

## Overview
Successfully implemented a improved UX design for the EditorJS Image Tool that makes image editing more discoverable and user-friendly.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Always-Visible Text Inputs
- **Alt Text Field**: Added a dedicated alt text input field that's always visible below the image
- **Caption Field**: Made the caption input always visible below the image (no longer hidden by default)
- **Better Accessibility**: Alt text field helps with accessibility compliance

### 2. Improved Data Structure
- Added `alt` property to `ImageToolData` type
- Added `size` property with predefined options: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'full'
- Added `alignment` property with options: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'
- Removed the old `stretched` boolean property in favor of the new size system

### 3. Enhanced UI Layout
- Text inputs container placed directly below the image
- Consistent styling for both alt text and caption fields
- Removed absolute positioning for better layout flow
- Maintained existing tune system for border, background, and link options

### 4. Maintained Backward Compatibility
- Existing tune system still works (border, background, link)
- Settings menu functionality preserved
- File upload and URL functionality unchanged

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **src/types/types.ts** - Updated data type definitions
2. **src/ui.ts** - Redesigned UI structure with always-visible inputs
3. **src/index.css** - Updated styling for new layout
4. **src/index.ts** - Updated data handling and removed stretched functionality
5. **dev/index.html** - Updated demo configuration

### New Features Working
✅ Alt text input (always visible)
✅ Caption input (always visible) 
✅ Border toggle
✅ Background toggle
✅ Link toggle (from previous implementation)
✅ Editable text fields
✅ Settings menu access

### Data Structure Example
```json
{
  "file": { "url": "..." },
  "caption": "Nature photography showcasing scenic mountain landscape",
  "alt": "A beautiful landscape with mountains and trees", 
  "withBorder": true,
  "withBackground": false,
  "withLink": true,
  "link": "https://example.com",
  "size": "medium",
  "alignment": "center"
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Caption field was hidden by default
- No alt text support
- Stretch toggle was confusing
- Text inputs not discoverable

### After  
- Both alt text and caption are immediately visible
- Clear accessibility support with dedicated alt text field
- Intuitive layout with inputs below image
- All functionality accessible through settings menu
- Better semantic data structure

## Testing
- Successfully tested all functionality in development environment
- Confirmed text editing works for both alt text and caption
- Verified tune toggles work (border, background, link)
- Build process completes successfully
- No TypeScript compilation errors

## Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
- Size preset controls in settings menu (small/medium/large/full)
- Alignment controls in settings menu (left/center/right)
- Visual indicators for current size and alignment settings

The implementation successfully delivers the requested "better UX" with discoverable caption and alt text fields that stay visible below the image, making the tool much more user-friendly and accessible.
